This project is developed using G++ Compiler in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The architecture used to develop this application is MVC (Model, View and Controller).

Why MVC ?
MVC is a modern architecture which is used by many modern applications. By using MVC our code looks clean and more readable. Another advantage of MVC is we can make changes in our application very easily. In this architecture everything is separated i.e User Interface is seperate from the Bussiness logic. In this way we also get security in our application.

How to compile ?
1- Install G++ compiler
2- Set global path in environment variable
3- Open command prompet
4- Navigate to the project folder
5- Run this command "g++ Main.cpp"
6- After compilation is successful, simply run "a.exe" file.

Congratulations! (*_*) Now the program is up and running.
